### A mod doesn't appear to be working after I install it properly.

### If your mod isn't working, refer to this checklist to see what step might be missing:

**Checklist:**

- [ ] Latest version of Desktop Goose
- [ ] Mod DLL is in mods folder within its own folder
- [ ] Config file has EnableMods=True
- [ ] Save the config
- [ ] Restart the program

## Older mods (v0.2-v0.21)

They do not use the modding API, instead they directly modify the Goose executable. They are also not able to be packed together, so you may only work with one mod at a time. 
We also do ***not*** recommend using older mods due to their directly manipulated nature. Consider using mods made with v0.3 or later.

* [Bobbie’s Modded Desktop Goose v0.2](mods/deprecated/bobbies.md)
* [NabMouse Mod](mods/deprecated/NabMouse.md)
* [Highly Configurable Goose](mods/deprecated/HiConfGoose.md)
* [Shaggy's Name Mod](mods/deprecated/ShaggysNameMod.md)
* [Shaggy's Sound Control](mods/deprecated/ShaggysSoundControl.md)
* [Shaggy's ImageCapFix](mods/deprecated/ShaggysImageCapFix.md)
