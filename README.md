### Q&A

Q: How do I uninstall the goose?
<br>A: Delete the Desktop Goose folder and all of its contents.

Q: Does Desktop Goose support more than one monitor?
<br>A: No, and it’s not planned at the moment. It works on one screen even if you have multiple monitors, and getting the goose to walk across screens is a whole thing.

Q: Will there be mod support on MacOS?
<br>A: This is not likely to happen soon.

Q: How do I make the goose do xyz?
<br>A: Most things about the goose are configurable in the goose.ini, alternatively if you are using Desktop Goose on MacOS you can configure the goose via Desktop Goose application. 

Q. What operating systems are officially supported?
<br>A: Windows, MacOS, the next port in line is for the Samsung Smart Fridge<sup>TM</sup>.

Q: Is the goose safe to run with video games?
<br>A: It depends, the goose biting the cursor may trigger anticheats in some multiplayer games. A community-maintained safety list is hosted [here](https://desktopgooseunofficial.github.io/ResourceHub/info/GameTestList.html).

Q: How do I add custom text boxes, or images for the goose to drag?
<br>A: In the DesktopGoose folder, there is an “Assets” folder - Add your own text and image files to the proper Images/Memes and Text locations in there!
