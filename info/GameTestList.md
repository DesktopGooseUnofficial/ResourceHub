**Notice:** At the moment there is someone testing games to see if games will ban users that use the Goose.

Some games may ban the players while the Desktop Goose is being used in the background.

These are subject to change at any time, so keep your eye out!

**We take no responsibility for any bans, and these games may start issuing bans at any time.**
