So, what do the content ratings (🙂😐☹️) mean?

The following explanations below are examples.

# ❓ Inapplicable

Anything that can't be properly rated, such as mod loaders.

# 🙂 Green level

All modifications only affect the goose!

# 😐 Yellow level

Anything that mildly messes with your computer input. Read the mod description for more info!

# ☹️ Red level

Anything that can seriously mess with your computer files, or block+alters your ability to control your computer input in a significant, unsafe way. Case-by-case.

# 🤯 Exploding level

**Exploding level is for mods that aren't allowed on ResourceHub.**

An "exploding-level" mod is one that can cause permanent, difficult-to-resolve or otherwise irreperable harm to a user's computer or their files, that mine or steal files from users' computers, that remove the ability to stop the goose, or otherwise contain malicious code.
