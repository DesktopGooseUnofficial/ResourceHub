Welcome to ResourceHub! We're glad you're here.

Before you begin making changes, here's some things you should keep in mind:

---

**Recommendations:**

💁‍♂️ Use [pull](https://github.com/wei/pull) on your ResourceHub forks

💁‍♂️ If you're new to GitHub, we recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

💁‍♂️ Publish the source code of those mods *before* you submit them

---

**Please do**:

✔️ Make awesome mods and put them on ResourceHub

---

**Please don't**:

❌ Add mods that go under the [exploding level](https://github.com/DesktopGooseUnofficial/ResourceHub/blob/master/info/ContentRatings.md#-exploding-level) content rating

❌ Add mods without adding their source code

---

Once again, we're glad you're here!
