## Tutorial on Custom Hats

1. Run the GooseDesktop.exe once (This will create a config.toml file)

2. Exit the program (press and hold esc)

3. Go to the Mods folder in the Assets folder

4. Open the Hatgoos Folder

5. Open the Config.toml file in Notepad (right click, select Open With, then select Notepad)

6. Set HatMode = "Default" to HatMode = "Custom"

7. Set the CustomHatPath = "" to an image path (it need two backslashes because it is a toml file)

**Example:**

CustomHatPath = "C:\\\Users\\\username\\\Downloads\\\PC\\\Desktop Goose Modded v0.3\\\Assets\\\Hats\\\hat3.png"

8. Save your Config.toml
