### Hatgoos Tutorial with Visuals
This mod allows you to have your goose wear hats it can also be run with other mods.

* First download the hatgoos mod

The file should say "hatgoos_with_loader.zip" when you download it

* Make sure to load it in the same area as the DesktopGoose.exe to unzip it should something like this
![The mods folder, three load bin files, and a run with mods.bats file should be in the same area as where the DesktopGoose.exe is placed along with your Assets folder.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672263146240737280/673282204100460554/unknown.png "The mods folder, three load bin files, and a run with mods.bats file should be in the same area as where the DesktopGoose.exe is placed along with your Assets folder.")

* Delete the config file

* Then run the 'run with mods.bat' that you see above

* Then exit that program

* Open up the newly created config file

What you should see the last 4 lines the same on that notepad (Do not worry about the other configuration settings on that notepad):

![The following 4 lines should be seen in your newly creeated config file: HatGoos.HatMode=Default, HatGoos.HorizontalSize=1.5, HatGoos.HatPosition=0.6, HatGoos.CustomHatPath=](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672263146240737280/673283260335521812/unknown.png "The following 4 lines that will be added to your config file: HatGoos.HatMode=Default, HatGoos.HorizontalSize=1.5, HatGoos.HatPosition=0.6, HatGoos.CustomHatPath=")

* Edit this part:
HatGoos.HatMode=Default

* To this:
HatGoos.HatMode=Custom

* Last but not least copy the location of the hat you want which you can do by clicking the search bar of your file manager and copying it.

See here:
![An arrow is pointing to show where to click. It's pointing at the bar that describe the location of the image Example: This PC > Downloads > PC > Assets > Images.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/672554163925942328/673297535464505381/unknown.png "An arrow is pointing the to a bar that describe the location of the image Example: This PC > Downloads > PC > Assets > Images.")

**Note:** Don't forget to include the name of the image file

* Paste it in HatGoos.CustomHatPath= 

So it should look more like this

Example:
HatGoos.CustomHatPath=C:\Users\user\Downloads\PC\Desktop Goose\Assets\Images\Hats\hat5.png

* Remember to save the Config file's changes

* Run the 'run with mods.bat' file once more and you're done!



**Notice:** If you run the DesktopGoose.exe you will end up corrupting the file. You should be running with 'run with mods.bat' everytime. If the file does get corrupted, delete the config file and make new one using the 'run with mods.bat' again. Otherwise you may have to startover.

**Note:** Also it can take a while for the goose to show up if you are using certain mods. You can still press esc to exit the program. If you don't want hats then change HatGoos.HatMode= to HatGoos.HatMode=None in the Config file.
